# Mapbox Directions Generator

Used to generate directions from two different points. My use case is generating directions and a map for my commute between home and work. It uses [Mapbox's](www.mapbox.com) APIs which take into account traffic. It also generates a static image file for displaying to me to best visualize the directions (i.e. I don't need turn by turn directions, only an idea of what the best way to go would be).

## Setup

Add the relevant data points to `config.json` as appropriate, including Mapbox API key.
